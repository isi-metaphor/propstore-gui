### Data

If you'd like to deploy the web-service to your own server, you can obtain the data needed to generate indexes from [this](https://github.com/isi-metaphor/propstore-data) repository. Due to limitations of the github, that repository contains limited datasets (~7M of the most frequent relations). If you need the full dataset, feel free to contact [me](mailto:zaytsev@usc.edu).

Proposition stores are derived from ruWac and Gigaword corpora and licensed under CC-BY license. See ABOUT.md and https://github.com/isi-metaphor/propstore-data/LICENSE for more details.
